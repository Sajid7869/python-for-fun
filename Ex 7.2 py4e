7.2 Write a program that prompts for a file name, 
then opens that file and reads through the file, 
looking for lines of the form: X-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475 
Count these lines and extract the floating point values from each of the lines and 
compute the average of those values and produce an output as shown below. 
Do not use the sum() function or â€¦
code:
#Use the file name mbox-short.txt as the file name

fname = input("Enter file name: ")

fh = open(fname)

count = 0

average = 0

for line in fh:

    if not line.startswith("X-DSPAM-Confidence:") : continue

    average += float(line[20:-1].strip())

    count = count + 1

    #print(line)

    

print("Average spam confidence:", (average/count))
